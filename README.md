## Guide

### Database migrations

All table definitions live in `incrementer/resources/private/migrations`, where each migration has a corresponding `.up.sql` and `.down.sql` file.  When you want to make a change to incrementer's schema, such as to add a table for storing comments:
```bash
lein brevity migrate new basic-comment-table
```
This will put empty files, named something like `20180716210558-basic-comment-table.down.sql` and `20180716210558-basic-comment-table.up.sql`, in  `incrementer/resources/private/migrations/`.  Next, open the `.up.sql` file and type in your table definitions:
```sql
create table comments (
  id bigserial primary key,
  comment text not null,
  date_added timestamp default now()
);
```

Then in `.down.sql`:
```sql
drop table comments;
```

Then to run this migration, simply execute `lein brevity migrate` again.  You should also run `lein brevity migrate` after pulling or changing branches.
